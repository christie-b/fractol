This project is about creating fractals using complex numbers, with the help of the 42 Minilibx (graphic library).
This project is **ONLY** working on Linux.

** HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM**  
`./fractol fractal_set [param 1] [param 2]`  
fractal sets are `julia`, `mandelbrot` and `burning`  
Parameters are only for the Julia set (Cx and Cy).  
You can exit the program using the `ESC key` or clicking on the red arrow.  

Bonuses implemented: 
- Additional fractal (Burning Ship)  
- Zoom that follows the mouse direction  
- Moving the view by pressing the arrow keys
